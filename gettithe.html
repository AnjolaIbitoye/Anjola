        <h4><img src="images.png" height="100" class="music">Worship through music:</h4>So often we equate worship with music.<br>But it isn’t the same thing;
         music is an avenue of worship,<br> it can direct our hearts to the Lord.<br>
        I believe the Lord created music just for this purpose.

      <div class="prayer">
        <h4> <img src="" alt=""> Worship through prayer: </h4>Praying the Scriptures back to the Author is a powerful way to worship.<br> Start with praying the Psalms.<br> But even if you don’t pray the Scriptures, at least pray.
        <br> God delights to hear our prayers (Psalm 66:19-20; Revelation 8:3, 4). <br>He delights in answering them.<br> He delights in blessing His children.
        <br> Delight the Father’s heart in prayer.

      <div class="thanks">
        <h4> <img src="" alt="">Worship through praise and thanksgiving: </h4>There are more than 250 verses in Scripture that speak of praise – <br>almost 150 in Psalms alone! If you don’t think praise is important,<br> check out Psalms 146 – 150. Praise means simply telling God how great He is <br>– praise Him for His love, His forgiveness, His patience, His creation,<br>
         His gifts, for anything and everything. Thanksgiving is similar.
        Instead of praising Him for who He is,<br> we praise Him for what He has done for us personally.
        <br>Got two eyes to see? Thank him. Got a roof over your head?<br> Thank Him. Got food on the table? Thank Him.<br> Thank Him in everything (1 Thessalonians 5:18).

<div class="word">
  <h4> <img src="" alt=""> Worship through the Word:</h4> Spending time in the Word every day is a way of worshipping the Father.<br> He gave us the Word and wants us to use it and love it (Psalm 119:97, 113, 163).<br>
   Psalm 119 is a beautiful tribute to the Word.<br> If you want to fall in love with the Word, spend a few days there.
